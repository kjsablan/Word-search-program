# Word-search-program
Program written in C++ to search a large list of words, a hw assigment completed in college in my data structures course.
This program reads a large list of words into a hash table.
The program asks you to input a word and will search for the word
If the word exists in the hash table it will output "found (word)"
If the word is doesn't exist or is misspelled then the program will output "not found", as well as the time it took to find the word
